### Dimensionality Reduction (PCA, LDA, t-SNE)

Dimensionality reduction is an important tool in unsupervised learning, and refers to the process of reducing the number of features in a dataset while still preserving the essential information. It is used to simplify datasets with many features, making them easier to interpret and visualize.

One common use-case of dimensionality reduction is reducing the number of features in a dataset so that it can be used with a machine learning algorithm that cannot process datasets with too many features. For example, if a dataset has 100 features and a machine learning algorithm can only process datasets with 10 or fewer features, dimensionality reduction can be used to reduce the number of features to 10 without losing any important information.

Another use-case of dimensionality reduction is to reduce the noise in a dataset. This can be done by combining similar features into one feature, or by removing features that are not important to the dataset. For example, if a dataset contains 100 features but only 10 of them are important for predicting a certain outcome, dimensionality reduction can be used to reduce the dataset to only 10 features. This reduces the noise in the dataset and makes it easier to interpret.

We will discuss the following dimensionality reduction techniques in this section:
- PCA
- LDA
- t-SNE
