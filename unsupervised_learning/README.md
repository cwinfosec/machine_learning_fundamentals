## Unsupervised Learning

Unsupervised learning is a type of machine learning where the algorithm learns patterns and relationships in unlabeled data without explicit supervision. The goal of unsupervised learning is to uncover hidden structure and relationships in the data and to find a way to represent the data in a more compact or informative manner.

For example, an unsupervised learning algorithm could be used to group similar customer profiles based on their purchase history. The algorithm would analyze the customer data to identify patterns and relationships and then group the customers into distinct clusters based on their similarities. This could be useful for marketing and customer segmentation, as it would allow businesses to better understand their customers and target their marketing efforts more effectively.

Unsupervised learning is often used for exploratory data analysis, dimensionality reduction, and clustering. Unlike supervised learning, unsupervised learning does not have a clear evaluation metric and the results are highly dependent on the choice of algorithm and the interpretation of the results by the user. The following is a list of unsupervised learning techniques that we will discuss in this chapter:

-   Clustering (K-means, Hierarchical, DBSCAN)
-   Dimensionality Reduction (PCA, LDA, t-SNE)
-   Association Rule Learning (Apriori, Eclat)
-   Autoencoders
-   Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)
-   Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs)
