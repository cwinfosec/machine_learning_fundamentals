### Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs)

Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs) are a type of generative probabilistic model used for unsupervised learning. RBMs are made up of two layers of neurons, a visible layer and a hidden layer. The visible layer contains the input data and the hidden layer contains a set of features that can be learned from the input data. The connections between the two layers are weighted and can be adjusted through a learning algorithm.

The purpose of RBMs is to learn the probability distribution of the input data, which can then be used to generate new data that is similar to the original data. RBMs can be used for a variety of tasks, such as dimensionality reduction, feature learning, and classification.

Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs) are a type of probabilistic graphical model that use the Boltzmann Distribution to represent joint probabilities of a set of random variables. The Boltzmann Distribution is given by the following equation:
```
P(x) = e^(-E(x))/Z
```
where `E(x)` is the energy of a given state `x`, and `Z` is a normalizing factor known as the partition function.

The energy of a given state `x` is given by the following equation:
```
E(x) = -∑i∑j wij xi xj - ∑i bi xi
```
where `wij` and `bi` are weights and biases, respectively, and `xi` and `xj` are variables.

RBMs use this energy equation to represent the joint probability of a set of random variables, and can be used to learn the weights and biases of a network.

A simple example of an RBM use-case is a recommendation system. Given a set of user ratings for movies, an RBM can be used to learn the probability distribution of the user ratings and then generate new recommendations based on the learned probability distribution. The generated recommendations can then be used to suggest new movies to users.

Here is an example code for a movie recommendation system using Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs) in Python:
```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.neural_network import BernoulliRBM

# Load the movie ratings data into a pandas dataframe
ratings_data = pd.read_csv('movie_ratings.csv')

# Convert the movie ratings data into a matrix where each row represents a user and each column represents a movie
user_item_matrix = ratings_data.pivot(index='user_id', columns='movie_id', values='rating')
user_item_matrix = user_item_matrix.fillna(0)

# Train the RBM model on the user-item matrix
rbm = BernoulliRBM(n_components=10, learning_rate=0.1, n_iter=50)
rbm.fit(user_item_matrix)

# Use the trained RBM model to generate new movie recommendations for a user
user_ratings = user_item_matrix.iloc[0, :].to_numpy().reshape(1, -1)
new_ratings = rbm.gibbs(user_ratings)
new_ratings = new_ratings.round().astype(int)

# Convert the new movie ratings back into a pandas dataframe and print the recommendations
new_ratings_df = pd.DataFrame(new_ratings, columns=user_item_matrix.columns)
print('Movie Recommendations:')
print(new_ratings_df.loc[0, new_ratings_df.loc[0, :] > 0])
```

Note that this code assumes that the movie ratings data is in the form of a CSV file named movie_ratings.csv, with columns for user_id, movie_id, and rating. The code also assumes that the movie ratings are on a scale of 0 to 5, with 0 indicating that the user has not rated the movie.

Here is an example of a `movie_ratings.csv` file that could be used with the code for the movie recommendation system based on Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs):
```
user_id,movie_id,rating
1,1,4
1,2,3
1,3,2
2,1,5
2,2,4
3,3,5
```

The first row of the file is the header, with the columns indicating the user ID, the movie ID, and the rating that the user gave to the movie. The following rows are the data, with each row representing the rating that a user gave to a movie. In this example, user 1 rated movie 1 with 4 stars, movie 2 with 3 stars, and movie 3 with 2 stars. Similarly, user 2 rated movie 1 with 5 stars and movie 2 with 4 stars. User 3 rated movie 3 with 5 stars.
