### Clustering (K-means, Hierarchical, DBSCAN)

Clustering is a common unsupervised learning technique used to group similar objects together in a dataset. The goal of clustering is to partition the data into clusters, where each cluster is made up of objects that are more similar to each other than to objects in other clusters. Clustering is often used to explore and understand the structure of data and to discover hidden patterns and relationships in the data.

A simple use-case of clustering is customer segmentation in marketing. Suppose a company wants to understand its customer base better and create targeted marketing campaigns. The company can use clustering to group customers based on their demographic information (age, income, location, etc.) and purchase history. The result of the clustering algorithm would be a set of customer segments, each representing a group of customers with similar characteristics. The company can then create targeted marketing campaigns for each customer segment based on their unique needs and preferences.

In summary, clustering is a useful technique for discovering patterns and relationships in large and complex datasets, especially when the desired outcome is not well-defined. The choice of clustering algorithm depends on the type and structure of the data, as well as the desired properties of the clusters, such as size, shape, and separation.

We will discuss the following clustering topics in this section:
- K-means
- Hierarchical
- DBSCAN
