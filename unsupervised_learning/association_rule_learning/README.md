### Association Rule Learning (Apriori, Eclat)

Association rule learning is a type of unsupervised learning algorithm used to discover relationships between variables in a dataset. It is used to identify which items are frequently bought together, and can be used to create associations between items.

The algorithm works by scanning through the dataset and looking for patterns of items that are frequently bought together. It then creates rules that describe the relationships between the items. For example, if a dataset contains grocery store purchase data, the algorithm might create a rule that states that people who buy apples are more likely to buy oranges.

A simple use case example would be a grocery store using association rule learning to identify which items customers are likely to buy together. This information can then be used to create promotional offers or discounts, or to create more efficient product placement in the store. Additionally, the store could use the data to identify new products to add to their selection.

In this section, we will discuss two association rule learning techniques:
