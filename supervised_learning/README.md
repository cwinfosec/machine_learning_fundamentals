## Supervised Learning

Supervised learning is a type of machine learning where the algorithm learns from labeled data to make predictions or take actions based on input data. The goal of supervised learning is to build a model that maps inputs to their corresponding outputs based on the labeled examples provided during training.

For example, a supervised learning algorithm could be used to predict housing prices based on a set of input features such as location, number of bedrooms, square footage, etc. The algorithm would be trained on a dataset of labeled examples of houses and their corresponding prices. Once the model is trained, it can then be used to make predictions on new, unseen examples of houses and their prices.

Supervised learning is one of the most widely used machine learning techniques because it can be used to solve a wide range of problems, including classification, regression, and prediction tasks. The quality of the model's predictions depends on the quality of the training data and the choice of model. The following is a list of supervised learning techniques that we will discuss in this chapter:
-   Linear Regression
-   Logistic Regression
-   Support Vector Machines (SVMs)
-   Decision Trees and Random Forests
-   Neural Networks 
-   K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
-   Naive Bayes
-   Gradient Boosting and AdaBoost
