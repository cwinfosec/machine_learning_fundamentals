### Co-training

Co-training in semi-supervised learning is a method of training two different classifiers on two different views of the same data. This method is used in cases where labeled data is limited, and the two classifiers are trained on different views of the data. The two views are typically created by different feature sets.

The idea behind co-training is that the two classifiers can learn from each other and improve their performance over time. This is accomplished by each classifier labeling the data that it is most confident in, and then the other classifier can use that labeled data to improve its own performance. This iterative process continues until the performance of both classifiers has reached a desired level.

A simple use case example of co-training in semi-supervised learning would be a classification problem where there are two different views of the data, such as images and text. The two classifiers could be trained on the images and text, respectively, and then they could iteratively label the data they are most confident in. This would allow each classifier to improve its performance over time, and eventually reach a desired level of accuracy.
