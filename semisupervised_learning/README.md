## Semi-Supervised Learning

Semi-supervised learning is a type of machine learning that combines both supervised and unsupervised learning to make use of both labeled and unlabeled data. The goal of semi-supervised learning is to improve the performance of a supervised learning algorithm by leveraging additional unlabeled data.

For example, a semi-supervised learning algorithm could be used for image classification where only a small portion of the images are labeled and the rest are unlabeled. The algorithm would use the labeled data to train a supervised learning model and use the additional unlabeled data to improve the model's performance. The idea is that the model can learn additional patterns and relationships in the data by using the unlabeled data in addition to the labeled data.

Semi-supervised learning is often used when labeled data is scarce or expensive to obtain, and can lead to improved performance compared to supervised learning with limited labeled data. The performance of a semi-supervised learning algorithm is dependent on the quality of the labeled data and the choice of algorithm. The following is a list of semi-supervised learning techniques that we will discuss in this chapter:

    -   Self-training
    -   Co-training
    -   Multi-view learning
