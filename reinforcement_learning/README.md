## Reinforcement Learning

Reinforcement learning is a type of machine learning where an agent learns to make decisions by interacting with an environment and receiving feedback in the form of rewards or penalties. The goal of reinforcement learning is to find the best policy, which maps states to actions, that maximizes the expected cumulative reward over time.

For example, a reinforcement learning algorithm could be used to train an agent to play a video game. The agent would take actions, such as moving left or right, and receive rewards or penalties based on the results of its actions, such as reaching the end of the level or losing a life. Over time, the agent would learn the optimal policy for playing the game, such as avoiding enemies and collecting power-ups.

Reinforcement learning is often used for decision-making problems where an agent needs to make decisions in a dynamic environment to maximize a reward signal. Reinforcement learning is used in a variety of applications, including robotics, autonomous vehicles, game playing, and recommendation systems. Unlike supervised and unsupervised learning, reinforcement learning involves a trial-and-error process where the agent receives feedback through interaction with the environment. We will discuss the following reinforcement learning techniques in this chapter:
