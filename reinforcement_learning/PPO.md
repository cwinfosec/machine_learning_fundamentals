### Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)

Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) is a reinforcement learning algorithm that is used to optimize a policy. It is an off-policy algorithm, meaning it can learn from data that was collected from a previous policy. PPO is an improvement on Trust Region Policy Optimization (TRPO) as it is more sample efficient and has fewer hyperparameters.

At its core, PPO is an iterative method for optimizing a policy by maximizing a special objective function. This objective function is composed of a measure of expected reward and a measure of policy change. The expected reward is the average reward for a given action, and the measure of policy change is the KL-divergence between the new policy and the old policy. By optimizing this objective function, the policy is updated to maximize expected reward while keeping the change in policy small.

PPO seeks to find a policy that maximizes the expected reward. The objective function for PPO is defined as:
```
Objective Function = E[r(θ)] + β * KL(π(θ)||π(θ'))
```
Where:
```
• r(θ) is the expected reward for the policy with parameters θ
• β is a hyperparameter that controls the trade-off between exploration and exploitation
• KL(π(θ)||π(θ')) is the Kullback-Leibler divergence between two policies π(θ) and π(θ')
```
The goal of PPO is to find the optimal policy parameters `θ*` that maximize the objective function. This can be done by taking the gradient of the objective function with respect to θ and using gradient ascent to update the policy parameters.

A simple use-case example of PPO can be seen in a game of chess. In this example, PPO can be used to learn a policy that will maximize the expected reward of winning a game of chess. The expected reward would be the probability of winning a game, and the policy change would be the difference between the old policy and the new policy. By optimizing this objective function, the agent can learn a policy that will maximize its chances of winning a game of chess.
