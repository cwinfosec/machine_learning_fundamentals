## Ensemble Learning

Ensemble learning is a type of machine learning where multiple models are trained and combined to produce a single, more accurate model. The goal of ensemble learning is to leverage the strengths of multiple models to improve the overall performance compared to any individual model.

For example, an ensemble learning algorithm could be used for image classification where multiple models are trained on the same dataset and their predictions are combined to produce a single, more accurate prediction. The combination of multiple models can lead to improved performance compared to using a single model, as the models may have different strengths and weaknesses that complement each other. Common methods for combining multiple models include voting, averaging, and weighting.

Ensemble learning is often used to improve the performance of machine learning algorithms, especially in competitions and real-world applications where high accuracy is desired. The performance of an ensemble learning algorithm depends on the choice of base models, the combination method, and the diversity of the models. The following is a list of ensemble learning techniques that we will discuss in this chapter:

    -   Bagging
    -   Boosting
    -   Stacking
