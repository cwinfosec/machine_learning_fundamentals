### Uncertainty Sampling

Uncertainty sampling is a strategy used in active learning, which is a type of machine learning where the model is trained with the help of a human. Active learning involves the use of a selection process to choose which data points to label and use in training. Uncertainty sampling is a selection process that focuses on selecting data points that are “uncertain” or difficult for the model to classify. The goal is to select data points that the model is least sure of, so that the model can learn from those data points and become more accurate in its predictions.

Uncertainty sampling is a type of active learning, which is a machine learning technique that seeks to reduce the amount of labeled data needed to train a model. It does this by selecting data points for labeling that are the most uncertain or ambiguous. The goal is to maximize the information gain of the model with the fewest possible labels.

The equation used to calculate the uncertainty of a data point is:
```
Uncertainty = 1 - max(P(c)) 
```
where `P(c)` is the probability of the data point belonging to a certain class. The higher the uncertainty, the more likely it is that the data point should be labeled.

A simple use case example would be a machine learning model that is used to classify images of cats and dogs. With uncertainty sampling, the model would select images that it is least sure about, so that it can be more accurately trained on the differences between cats and dogs. This could include images of cats with unusual markings, or images of cats and dogs that are difficult to distinguish between. By selecting these uncertain images, the model can become more accurate in its classifications.

Uncertainty sampling is a powerful tool in active learning, as it allows a model to focus on the data points that it is least sure of. This helps the model to become more accurate in its predictions, as it can learn from the difficult data points that it selects. Uncertainty sampling can be used in a variety of applications, such as image classification, natural language processing, and more.
